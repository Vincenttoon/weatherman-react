This application has quick links, search, current location and displays information in both metric and imperial values.

## Live Deployment

* [Live Deployment Link](https://weatherman-react.vercel.app/)

## Technologies

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) based application. Use states, effect and hooks to create a dynamic single page application.

* [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) was primarily used for format and styling. This was one my first applications of tailwind. Super smooth and easy to use. Dynamic and Versatile.

* [Luxon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/luxon) was used for date and time implementation. This package was much easier to use than the build in Javascript time functionality. Would definitely use again in the future.

* [Iconscout](https://iconscout.com/) was used for the icons. Pretty straight-forward. No better or worse than other icon stores I've used.

* [React-Toastify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify) was used to inform users on fetching and success of searching for locations. Neat little feature to let the user know that the application is working on the API end. 

## Usage

* Use the live link. 
* Search for cities all over the world. 
* Change the values. 
* Enjoy.
